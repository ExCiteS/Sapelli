Sapelli
=======

### What? ###
[Sapelli](http://sapelli.org) is a mobile data collection and sharing platform designed with a specific focus on non-literate and illiterate users with little or no prior ICT experience.

It supports the creation of surveys (called "projects"), composed of 1 or more forms. Forms can be entirely text-free, using the concept of pictorial decision trees, or have a more conventional appearance consisting of standard UI widgets. Sapelli supports data exchange using a highly efficient protocol that can work across SMS and HTTP.
